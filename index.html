      <p> My hobby is tech, I know how to edit videos, write html/css and I currently want to learn php and java script.</p>
      <p> Here I will upload updates of my new computer, (our computers section) Hardware recommendations (Hardware Recommendations section) Information (Information section) and links to new videos on my channel!!!</p>
