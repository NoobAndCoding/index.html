    I will be making videos in like 3 weeks I get my new PC! I will also be making a video about building it, and we will make videos about
    upgrading it with parts I will buy myself. <br/> You should also get ready for the series that I will launch when we will hit 500 subs, where
    probably, if nothing changes in my mind, I will be reviewing your pc setus guys!</p>
